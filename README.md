Assignment- Database Design and Applications MM: 10
Describe a problem statement of your own choice. The problem statement should
a) Match to a real life system.
b) Include at least 5 entities and 5 relationships including one weak entity.
c) Indicate cardinality of relationship.
d) Indicate total participation rules and partial participation rules.
Perform the following tasks based on problem statement.
1. Draw a detailed entity relationship/enhanced entity relationship (ER/EER) diagram.
2. Convert the ER/EER diagram to tables.
3. Create tables using some relational DBMS and populate tables with relevant data.
4. Identify at least 25 (5 for each student) significant retrieval queries and implement those queries in SQL. Choose those queries which make use of joins, group by, order by and aggregate functions.
Instructions
1. Clearly write the problem statement and write as much detail as you can. It should match with real life scenario.
2. Identify the entities, relationships and draw ER/EER diagram detailing cardinality of relationships and total/partial participation rules.
3. Convert the ER/EER diagram to relations. The schema derived from ER/EER diagram should clearly indicate primary keys and foreign keys.
4. Create the schema using RDBMS. Write SQL query for each table creation and output after successful creation of each table.
5. Insert some dummy data into tables at least 10 rows in each table. Write insert statements and snapshot of table after insert statements.
6. Write statements about select queries, then execute queries in SQL and record the output. For each statement record SQL query and its output.
Note
• This is group assignment. Each group should choose unique problem statement.
• Do not choose any problem statement that has been discussed in text book(s), reference book(s), or lectures.
• The solutions for the chosen application should not be readily available on the Internet. The same would be rejected.
• You may use BITS virtual lab platform for performing steps 4 to 6 mentioned in instructions.
